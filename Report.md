## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    Basically its like a mailing address wherein provides for us an address to access something.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    DNS functions similiarly to a phone put wherein domain names are represented to mean specific IPs. Domain names are also easier for humans to remember rather than IP addresses.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Both provide an IP addres, however, a static IP address does not change over time, while a dynamic IP can change over time.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    UDP is fast but does not establish a connection before sending thus could loose data in transmission, while TCP is slower due to establishing a connection however is more reliable in data transfer.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event drivin thus a delay would interfere with the timing of the program.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    A blocking function prevents any other code from being executed while it is being run.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

   The program lets the CPU know when it needs access to it's resources rather than constantly use its resources such as in a blocking program.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines how a function is called, while implementation is how the function executes .
